# Getting Started
This project provides a starting point for building a server application using Express.js. Follow these steps to get your server up and running:

## 1. Project Setup

- Create a new directory for your project.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory using the cd command.
- Initialize a new package.json file, which will manage your project's dependencies, by running:


```javascript
npm init -y
```

## 2. Install Express.js
Install the Express.js framework using npm (Node Package Manager):
```javascript
npm install express
```
This command downloads the Express package and adds it to your project's dependencies list in package.json

## 3. Create the Server File (server.js)
- Create a new file named server.js in your project directory.
- This file will contain the code for your Express application.

## 4. Basic Server Structure
Here's a template for the server.js file that demonstrates a basic server setup:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Basic route handler (example)
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from your Express server!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port 3000`);
});

```


## 5. Running the Server

```javascript
node server.js

```
This command runs the server.js file using Node.js, and your server will start listening on the designated port


## 6. Accessing Your Server
Open a web browser and navigate to the port your server is listening on (e.g., http://localhost:3000 if you're using the default port).
