[Chorus]
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
What are they feeding you?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
It's not your fault

[Verse 1]
They won't take you to the vet
You're obviously not their favorite pet

[Chorus]
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
It's not your fault

[Verse 2]
You may not be a bed of roses
You're not friend to those with noses
I'll miss you before we're done
Or the world will smell as one

[Chorus]
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
What are they feeding you?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
It's not your fault
Oh, are we done?

[Post-Chorus]
One, two, what's that smell?

[Chorus 2]
Smеlly Cat, Smelly Cat
What are they feeding you?
Smеlly Cat, Smelly Cat
You're getting fat
I think that I'm gonna be sick
It's your ears, and nose and pick
Part of it, tempt me

[Post-Chorus]
One, two, what's that smell?

[Chorus 3]
All the dogs in the neighborhood
Are saying this for your own good
What, you're fat, so you can't run
No fun, I bet, No fun
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
Porno makes you eat like that
I saw you in the shopping mall

[Chorus]
Smelly Cat
It's not your fault
Smelly Cat
It's not your fault
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
It's not your fault
We know what was in your food
They say it might affect your mood
